Personal GitHub iO Pages - Current Projects / Developments

[jamesrwilliams.github.io](https://jamesrwilliams.github.io)

The idea here is to have a github pages section setup for each of my current projects (ideally both personal and professional) to act as a portfolio.

## Current Projects

I still need to write docs for these however might bundle that with developing a docs template project that I can just drop in to new projects:

- foundation-emails-with-mailchimp
- google-maps-sandbox

## Past Projects

- Stroud Fringe App
- EE BoilerPlate

## University Projects

- uni-of-glos-year4-the-hybrid
- uni-of-glos-year4-hybrid-leap
- uni-of-glos-year4-we-are-kiwikiwi
- uni-of-glos-year4-the-hybrid-legacy
- uni-of-glos-year4-intro-to-scss
